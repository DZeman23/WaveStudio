# WaveStudio
A lightweight, Python-based graphical wavetable editor designed to draw, generate, manipulate, and export custom 2048-sample single-cycle waveforms. Built specifically as a companion tool for custom synthesizer engines (like CML-1), this studio outputs clean 16-bit RAW audio files ready for direct engine ingestion.
